The new fractal curve described in this paper is deterministic (though
it appears at a casual glance to be random), simple to specify, and
easy and quick to compute.  It will automatically fill any pre-defined
bounded and connected region of the plane, is self-avoiding, and never
self-intersects.  The definition of the curve is given, along with
pictures of it in two dimensions generated by a C++ implementation
(this software is freely available on the web).  Simulations of the
curve are statistically analysed with the result that---under a
well-defined and broad range of conditions---its fractal dimension is
about 1.5.  The curve can use a single line segment inside the bounded
region as a starting pattern, or a non-self-intersecting polyline.
Several of the curves can be generated in the same region, and will
fill it without crossing themselves or each other.  The definition
extends to any number of dimensions; in K dimensions the curve
would become a K-1 dimensional hypersurface filling a bounded
hypervolume.
