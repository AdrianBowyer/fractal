Many thanks for your reply.  I shall certainly talk to Peter; I know him, but only from a mutual work on exchange students from abroad; I am ashamed to say that I was not aware of his area of expertise.  Such is the hermetic separation of university administration from any activity requiring thought...

I attach a draft technical report on the idea.  Please don't feel obliged to look at it in detail - I shall take that up with Peter.  However, if the idea isn't novel (and I haven't been able to find it in my search of the literature), then perhaps you would be kind enough to let me know.

As you are at a meeting on fractals in engineering I should perhaps briefly say what those are for my construction, something that the report doesn't cover.  

The first is to use the equivalent of the curve in three dimensions (where it becomes a surface) as a separating porous membrane with a large surface area between two fluids, rather as the material of the lung separates air and blood.  Manufacturing the structure would seem initially difficult, but with modern rapid prototyping methods that allow the deposition of materials in three dimensions under computer control it ought to be quite straightforward.

The second is to use the curve itself to separate two electrical conductors on a flat two-dimensional printed circuit.  This allows the two conductors to be connected to the + and - sides of a power supply and to deliver power to any point over an area of any shape, but never to touch.  This in turn would allow one, for example, to make a ceiling of such a material and then magnetically to stick spotlights anywhere on it in any orientation and to power them.
